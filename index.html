            <p>
              Emma Watson is a great person and an amazing actor is beacuse she has so many emotions that really explain the story of a movie.Also she let's girls all over the world know that they can do anything they can dream of even if it's hard beacuse I'm sure acting in so many movies was hard but in the end it payed off. She also has an amzing voice which people love and can listen to forever.I think she is very Hero like to everybody.
